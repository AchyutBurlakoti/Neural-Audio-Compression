    Jitter implementation from [Chorowski et al., 2019].

    relying on consistency across groups of tokens. Additionally,
    this regularization also promotes latent representation stability
    over time: a latent vector extracted at time step t must strive
    to also be useful at time steps t âˆ’ 1 or t + 1.
